# BeardedSpice: Mac Media Keys for the Masses

BeardedSpice is a menubar application for Mac OSX that allows you to control web based media players with the media keys found on Mac keyboards. It is an extensible application that works with Chrome and Safari, and can control any tab with an applicable media player. BeardedSpice currently supports:

- YouTube
- HypeMachine
- Spotify (Web)
- Pandora
- BandCamp
- GrooveShark
- SoundCloud
- Last.fm
- Google Music
- Rdio

If you want another supported app supported, simply open an issue with the tag 'app support'. Or, if you are feeling extra feisty, implement the handler yourself!

BeardedSpice is built with [SPMediaKeyTap](https://github.com/nevyn/SPMediaKeyTap) and works well with other applications listening to media key events.
